Notes on the design of the project website

## Landing Page Sketch

![][1]

We are going for a modern look that is free of distraction so that our audience can focus on the content

1. The header navigation is fixed at the top of the page so that it is always visible even when scrolling
1. The project title "Elastic Compute" shoud be in the top left of the fixed nav.  It should be a link that reloads the full page, and navigates to the home position
1. Links to the major sections of the page, e.g. Overview, Video, Presentation, Findings, Analysis, etc.
1. The lead section should include a background image that evokes a feeling of the "a promising way forward"
1. Instead of titling the page with "Elastic Compute" we want to ask a provocative question, perhaps" What would you do with an extra Terawatt?".  We want the audience to "want" to know more.
1. Add a subtitle with the project name "Elastic Compute"
1. Author names
1. Link back to the Github repo, preferbaly something like "Fork Elastic Compute" or "View on Github"
1. Section type A heading
1. Section type A copy
1. Section type A image or video
1. Section type A background color #FFFFFF - white
1. Section type B image or video
1. Section type B heading and copy
1. Section B type background color #E0E0E0 - light grey
1. There will be two section types A and B that alternate down the page.  The A sections will have the image, video content in the left column and the copy on the right.  The B sections will be in reversed.  There should be some subtle diffences to visually distinguish the like the background color A being white #FFFFFF and B being a light grey #E0E0E0.  There is a lead header with a subtitle followed by content.
1. Footer section.  Clearly link the project source and data 
1. Linked buttons to the GitHub repository and provided a direct download link for people who don't use GitHub
1. Provide the same navigation at the bottom as is at the top to allow the user to return to a specific section
1. Provide a link to the "References & Acknowledgements" page where all citations are kept
1. Provide names and links to the GitHub profiles of the project authors
